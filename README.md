Short Answer Questions
1.	Question 1
a.	Since the convenience variable may be correlated with both sales and marketing, omitting it can cause bias in the marketing coefficient, leading to confounded results. Without controlling for convenience, we cannot isolate the causal effect of marketing on sales.
b.	Including convenience reduces omitted variable bias, strengthening our results. However, unless all confounders are accounted for and there’s random assignment, correlation doesn’t confirm causation.
c.	The change suggests that convenience might have been capturing the marketing effect. Yet, insignificance doesn’t prove no effect—only that our sample may not show a detectable effect under these conditions.
d.	This could indicate multicollinearity or a suppression effect. A negative shift does not imply causation, as underlying factors may be influencing results.
2.	Question 2
a.	With random assignment, a statistically significant coefficient on marketing does imply causation, as randomization controls for other influences.
b.	The marketing coefficient should remain consistent since randomization mitigates confounding. Any significant shift would likely indicate random variation.
3.	 (b) Including popularity is better because it controls for the indirect influence of marketing on sales via popularity, improving the accuracy of the marketing coefficient.
4.	Question 4
a.	Self-selection bias may skew results if more motivated individuals choose the training.
b.	Yes, using a coupon-based random selection allows causal inference by creating a comparable control group.
c.	Relevance, coupon affects training and Exogeneity, coupon does not directly affect productivity.
d.	Sum of all cells: N1 + N2 + N3 + N4.
e.	No, but having N1 > 0 ensures variability.
f.	Yes, to calculate the local average treatment effect.
